- 👋 Hi, I’m @WoofStar
- 👀 I’m interested in all aspects of IT and Software Developments 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all the new features for Firebase Google Cloud Google Cirq, PYPI, .NET, Workflows, and more!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that are comprehensive in nature and will serve a positive improvement to society or software needs  
- 📫 How to reach me - I am available, but also can be a very tricky rabit.resources 
- 😄 Pronouns: ... Canine/Dog/Wolf
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...I learbed everything I could by dedication, self-discipline, all-nighters, and oh yeah... losing my crypto wallet valued over 125 million helped spark the fire to learn - evolved into a meant to be moment. Capable of frauding fraudsters, learned Red Hat methods so I can be the White Hat I like to be. Wallet has been recovered and those involved have lost their identities, fortune, and darkweb fame! Cheers!
